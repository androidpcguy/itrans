# itrans
itrans - Convert encoded text to Unicode output - for Indic or other scripts

## Web site

The code here is used to run the [Online Itrans web page](http://www.aczoom/itrans/online/).

## Unicode tables

All Indic scripts with their Unicode names have been collected in a spreadsheet and the data in that spreadsheet drives the Online Itrans web site.

[itrans-unicode-mapping tables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14wZl8zCa4khZV3El2VGoqurKBLGx21mbS-yORi4w7Qo/edit?usp=sharing) is the default table.
That table can be copied and the data modified to support different input (or even output) codes, and the modified table can be loaded at the Online Itrans web site.

## TODO

Upload the Javascript source code for the web site here.
